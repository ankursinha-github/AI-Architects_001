# Al-Architects_001: Custom Programming Language and IDE

# Deployed Link : https://clonescriptlang.netlify.app/

# Project Overview

Welcome to Al-Architects_001, an innovative project that aims to create a new programming language along with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Our goal is to develop a language that supports fundamental programming concepts and an IDE that provides a user-friendly interface for writing and executing code in the language.

By the end of this project, we aim to deliver a fully functional language and IDE that empowers developers to efficiently write, test, and run code. This project showcases our team's ambition to build from scratch, innovate, and contribute to the programming community.

# Features

1. Programming Language Development
Language Syntax: We define a simple yet powerful syntax supporting variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions.
Compiler/Interpreter: A custom-built interpreter/compiler to parse, execute code, and handle errors.
Error Handling: Clear syntax and runtime error reporting to guide users and developers.

2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Syntax Highlighting: The IDE offers syntax highlighting for better readability and user experience.
Code Completion: Helps developers by suggesting code snippets and completing code statements.
Error Highlighting: The IDE displays inline error messages for faster debugging.
Console: A built-in console to execute code and display outputs/errors.

3. Comprehensive Documentation
Language Documentation: Full documentation of the language's syntax, rules, and example usage.
IDE User Guide: Detailed guide on how to use the IDE features, including code editing, error resolution, and executing code.

4. Login and Authentication
User authentication features to ensure secure access to the IDE and user accounts for managing projects.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
   - git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Al-Architects_001.git
   - cd Al-Architects_001

2. Open index.html in your browser to launch the IDE and start coding.

3. To test the language, open test.html and write your first code snippet in our custom programming language.
